## Taco Mountain

Taco mountain is a backend application written in node.js that emulates restaurant point of sale software. Customers are able to log in, place orders and accumulate and spend rewards points. Admins are able to edit the menu and view data aggregations regarding profit, sales, etc. Our application utilizes mongoDB, mongoose, and express. It uses a client made with Inquirer to interact with the server.

This presentation will discuss the process we implemented to develop and refactor the application within a five day period. We will focus on the logic behind the data aggregations, user authentication, and scalable model/schema relationships that make this quickly developed software nearly feature complete.
